# Dev Jobs Search

This project is a [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. They provided the design, assets, colors, and fonts. The implementation was entirely up to me.

It is a developer job search app built with React, TypeScript, and SCSS. You can filter jobs by title, location, and contract. When you find a job you're interested in
you can open the listing and read more.
